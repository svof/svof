    bin/default_prios                    = default priorities for Svof
    bin/*.lua                            = pre-processed Lua files - don't edit these, but the raw-svo.*.lua ones instead.
    doc/                                 = documentation in Sphinx.
    output/                              = storage location for build systems

    luapp.lua                            = Lua preprocessing libraries, allows compile-time modification of Lua code - helps with some of the monotonous and repeating functions

# How to's

## How to add a new affliction
1. add it in raw-svo.dict.lua in the dict table, with the appropriate functions and curing logic
1. add it in raw-svo.empty.lua
1. add it in raw-svo.valid.diag.lua and add a new diagnose trigger for it
1. add gaining affliction raw-svo.valid.simple.lua, and if there's any complicated logic around it, to raw-svo.valid.main.lua. Add triggers receiving the affliction.
1. add losing/curing affliction in raw-svo.valid.main.lua and the appropriate triggers
1. add to tree curing system (touchtree action in raw-svo.dict.lua and raw-svo.valid.main.lua)
1. add to generic cures (passive cures or cures that happen in blackout) (generic_cures_data in raw-svo.valid.main.lua)
1. check failure conditions and add them, ie salves fizzling off balance

## How to update madness status of an affliction
1. update raw-svo.dict for the affliction - check every balance
1. update madness_affs table in raw-svo.empty

## View system debug log
1. install [Logger](http://forums.mudlet.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1424)
1. view mudlet-data/profiles/\<profile>/log/svof.txt

## Gotcha with luapp
If luapp, the pre-processor has an error compiling, it doesn't seem to print any errors. The preprocessed file will just stop at the erroring line.
